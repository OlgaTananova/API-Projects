The task is: 

1) create a microservice which serves the contents of Player.csv through a REST API.

The service should expose two REST endpoints:
● GET /api/players - returns the list of all players.
● GET /api/players/{playerID} - returns a single player by ID.
* GET /api/players/page/{page} - returns the list of players by page

2) create unit tests that cover the core logic.

3) add GitHub Actions
